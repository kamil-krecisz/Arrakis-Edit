# Arrakis Edit

This is **Arrakis Edit** â€“ a ready-to-use Conky configuration with **hardcoded paths**.  
To work correctly, the repository **must be cloned directly into `~/.config/conky/`**.

## Installation

1. Make sure the Conky configuration folder exists:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/conky
```
2. Clone the repository into your Conky configuration folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamil-krecisz/Arrakis-Edit.git ~/.config/conky
```
3. Install all fonts located in ~/.config/conky/Arrakis-Edit/fonts and restart your system

4. Running
```bash
cd ~/.config/conky/Arrakis-Edit/
./start.sh
```
> **Note:** Do not move or rename the `~/.config/conky/Arrakis-Edit` folder, as paths in the configuration are hardcoded.
